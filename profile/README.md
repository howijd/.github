## **Introduction**

[howijd.network] is a [decentralized autonomous organization][dao] that utilizes smart contract-based blockchain technology as its foundation. It creates a chain of [lossless compressed][lossless-compression] blocks and is compatible with various other technologies and networks. Smart contracts are the primary focus of [howijd.network], as the majority of transaction volume is between user-deployed smart contracts rather than token transactions. The network also has a decentralized governance system and uses [Extended PFP NFTs][pfp] for participation in DAO Voting. Its main priorities are minimal resource usage and the reliability, speed, security, and accuracy of transactions and computations within the network.
