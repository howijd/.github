**Current roadmap phase:** [v0.3.0](https://github.com/orgs/howijd/projects/23)

## **Introduction**

> Hereby simplifyed version, detailed  in whitepaper and related specs 

[howijd.network] DAO [(decentralized autonomous organization)][dao] is [Smart Contract][smart-contract] first blockchain technology with intent to produce chain of [lossless compressed][lossless-compression] blocks to represent and imply intelligence of the general technology at the present. [howijd.network] is compatible with other blockchain, off-chain, centralized and decentralized technologies through BRIDGES, which are applied to the network through the CIP process, including its own forks.

BRIDGES here refers to a so-called software-based network gateway that ensures functionality sharing and fast cross-chain data exchange interoperability between completely different technologies. Therefore, it should not be confused with the various [howijd.network] protocol layers and sidechains. In the first era, [howijd.network] BRIDGES are software-based and integrated as a software component of a network node. By design, future implementations of [howijd.network] BRIDGES may be standalone hardware bridges or kernel modules regardless of host environment.

The network protocol parameters determine the BRIDGES of the active network and select the most trusted bridge as the home bridge. If a network failure occurs on the home bridge blockchain or network, the protocol will automatically recover by switching to the next available network bridge with the highest trust score. Trust value is determined by chain algorithms managed by the community through the DAO. Cardano was chosen as the initial home bridge of the first [howijd.network] mainly because of its Ouraboros protocol and Hydra scalability solution. Next to the home bridge, nearly 100 blockchain technologies were selected as the first active BRIDGEs simply based on their popularity.

[howijd.network] does not prioritize the long-term historical integrity of the chain, but its highest priority is to have a minimal footprint on the resources it needs to operate. At the same time, to ensure the reliability, speed, security and accuracy of transactions and computation done in the network. All these protocol functions and features are determined through collective improvement proposals and Switch Voting.

**Collective improvement proposals**, also known as community proposals, are improvements that change static protocol parameters or introduce changes to the [howijd.network] source code.

**Switch Voting** is a procedure where [Extended PFP NFT][pfp] with a specific identity can switch one or more protocol switches by voting. Protocol Switch can store boolean values true or false. How the protocol interprets these switches is introduced to the network through the CIP process.

Although all technologies, networks and other blockchains, including forks of itself, can coexist, communities on both sides can adopt a BRIDGE between them at any interection point. The design and purpose of bridges should generally be to connect different active technologies and enhance functions. However, a community may also use bridges to transfer a set of functions from one network to another, or to completely merge these networks, in which case one network would become active and the other passive, and would be defined in the BRIDGE parameters with the corresponding tag. A passively tagged network and this bridge are disposed after transfer using predefined parameters. following the rules implemented by the bridge.

A single network can consist of several groups of entities that jointly present CIPS. The Okram era introduces two such collectives, Humans and Mixed collective (APIs, BOTS, however you identify yourself), Mixed collective community can also include humans, e.g. bot authors, etc. A human CIP proposal is a proposal where all participants are human beings who have not used artificial means to gain an unfair advantage. These two categories coexist here to separate contributions from humans and contributions developed using, e.g., artificial intelligence, deep learning models, GPTs, etc. It is the responsibility of the community to define the nature and further categorization in the CIP process.

An active [howijd.network] network node removes unnecessary historical blocks that are not needed to ensure the integrity of the chain's current state, making network nodes extremely economical.

This approach was chosen because privacy protection through any blockchain technology may be true now, but not in the future. Blockchain is a verifiable chain of transactions and actions, and sooner or later something will break this privacy protection mechanism, even if it could happen long after your lifetime or tomorrow due to a hack from a bad or outdated implementation, or even right now.

[howijd.network] promotes innovation and efficient use of time and offers the user a simple and reliable central entry point to current technology domains with the necessary toolkit to navigate this reality.
